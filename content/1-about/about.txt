#Hello!<br/>My name is Robin Kurtz,

I am a graphic designer and front-end web developer based in Montreal. Born and raised in Montreal's West Island, I now live in the heart of the city and work in Old Montreal.

I currently work as a front-end web developer with some design on the side. I maintain a passion for both fields and continue to find new experiences to build from in both.
